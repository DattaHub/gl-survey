  abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

abstract ={For the problem of variable selection for the normal linear model, selection criteria such as aic, Cp , bic and ric have fixed dimensionality penalties. Such criteria are shown to correspond to selection of maximum posterior models under implicit hyperparameter choices for a particular hierarchical Bayes formulation. Based on this calibration, we propose empirical Bayes selection criteria that use hyperparameter estimates instead of fixed choices. For obtaining these estimates, both marginal and conditional maximum likelihood methods are considered. As opposed to traditional fixed penalty criteria, these empirical Bayes criteria have dimensionality penalties that depend on the data. Their performance is seen to approximate adaptively the performance of the best fixed?penalty criterion across a variety of orthogonal and nonorthogonal set?ups, including wavelet regression. Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimators of the selected coefficients are also proposed.},

In addition to borrowing many techniques from the statistics and engineering literatures, chemometrics itself has given rise to several new data-analytical methods. This article examines two methods commonly used in chemometrics for predictive modeling-partial least squares and principal components regression-from a statistical perspective. The goal is to try to understand their apparent successes and in what situations they can be expected to work well and to compare them with other statistical methods intended for those situations. These methods include ordinary least squares, variable subset selection, and ridge regression.},

abstract = "For analysis of multidrug resistance, a major barrier to effective cancer chemotherapy, we profiled mRNA expression of the 48 known human \{ABC\} transporters in 60 diverse cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) used by the National Cancer Institute to screen for anticancer activity. The use of real-time RT-PCR avoided artifacts commonly encountered with microarray technologies. By correlating the results with the growth inhibitory profiles of 1,429 candidate anticancer drugs tested against the cells, we identified which transporters are more likely than others to confer resistance to which agents. Unexpectedly, we also found and validated compounds whose activity is potentiated, rather than antagonized, by the \{MDR1\} multidrug transporter. Such compounds may serve as leads for development. "
